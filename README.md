# Ecommerce Website (Run4It)
This project is an ecommerce website centered around athletic apparel. It contains three pages routed together through react. The home page has slider images. The product page contains products, pulled from a MySQL database, that allows a user to filter by product type and price. The contact page has a form that dynamically adds the comment to the comment slider so users can see their comments. React and MySQL is linked together through Express.

## Getting Started

1. Use `npm install` to install all needed dependencies as listed by the package.json.

2. Use any preferred application to run the queries from the `.sql` files.

3. Create a `.env` in both the root directory and the test directory. The `.env` in the test directory should contain a different port for the tests.
